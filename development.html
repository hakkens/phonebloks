          <p><b>PROJECT ARA</b>
            <br>
            <br> With Project Ara, Google is trying to find a way for you to, in the future, use the hardware of your phone the same way you today use apps for your smartphone. You change apps on the go. You buy the apps that you need. For hardware, this means allowing you to enhance your smartphone experience by offering a structural base of a phone. This frame contains all the phone’s basics, including radios, processor, and a small battery. You get to enhance the phone with customizable, hot-swappable modules that allow you to customize the camera, speakers, batteries and more that insert into Ara’s six flexible slots for easy swapping. These modules can be inserted and removed at any time, even while the device is powered on. Consumers will be able to configure all the enhancements they want for their own custom device, and buy additional modules through the Ara open marketplace.

            <br>
            <br> Puzzle Phone is a modular mobile phone designed in Finland and engineered in Europe. The idea behind the phone is to have a reliable device that is easy to upgrade and repair. It is equipped with Open Source code for reliable auditing and community support. Three easily replaceable and customizable modules allow upgrades and on-the-fly, easy repairs. The tree modules are: The Spine - the high­-res display with core elements that will be available in a variety of sizes and materials. The Brain - containing the critical electronics such as the CPU, GPU, RAM, memory, and cameras. And The Heart - holding the battery and a secondary set of electronics that can be developed according to user needs.

            <br>
            <br> Fonekraft was a concept for a modular mobile phone from Austria. It all started when the founders both saw the original Phonebloks video and decided that they had to take part in the modular revolution. The plan is to release three starter versions of the phone. The basic model Pilot, budget friendly with two batteries for a lengthy battery time. Resolution, a camera and storage heavy version for all Instagramers out there. And, HiFi for audiophiles. It was succesfully funded on Indiegogo in 2014. However, the website and Indiegogo page have both been pulled down due to Trust and Safety issues and it is unknown when it will become available for sale again.

They open up supply chains to understand how things are made and build stronger connections between people and their products. With the Fairphone 2 they’ve joined the modular revolution. The Fairphone 2’s inventive modular architecture gives users more control over their phone, including the ability to easily open and repair the most commonly broken parts. Modular components slot into the back and can be easily replaced. To help it last longer, the phone also features high-quality components and innovations like an integrated protective case.

          <p><b>MOTOROLA</b>
            <br> Nowadays Motorola has nothing to do with Project Ara, and to our knowledge, nothing to do with modularity but they were the company that really helped get the ball rolling. Motorola was the company that initiated the Make With MoTo Tour,
            a pan America car tour that helped them understand that people want to be able to customize their phones. They also initiated the ATAP team, the team responsible for developing Project Ara. During both of these endeavors they were owned by
            Google. Google has since sold Motorola to Lenovo, keeping the ATAP team, keeping on developing Project Ara. But no Motorola, no Make With Moto, no ATAP team, no Project Ara. So, for that, we salute them!

            <br> Sennheiser was one of the first companies to really dive head first into modularity. Over the course of nearly a year they worked closely with us at Phonebloks and the Phonebloks community for the development of not one, but two Project Ara
            sound-bloks. Getting help from the Phonebloks community on each step of the design process they not only totally emerged themselves in modularity but also in open innovation and crowd development. And for that, we salute them!

            <br> After seeing the original Phonebloks video back in 2013, the founding members of Blocks got an idea. What about a modular smartwatch? Said and done the guys slowly but surely started working towards their goal of the best modular wearable
            there can ever be. They have over the passed two years gone from certainty to certainty and are now (2015) about to embark on a crowdfunding campaign that will lead to a public release. We totally love what these guys are doing and for that,

            <br> Apart from aiming to drive the development of modular consumer electronics forward, one of the cornerstones of Phonebloks is helping to reduce the electronic waste streams. One major way to do this is to repair your broken electronics instead
            of throwing them away. This is where iFixit comes in. Acknowledging the fact that many brands and distributors have ceased to offer repairs, instead opting for whole widget replacement, iFixit provides us, the consumers, with manuals and easy
            step by step guides on how to repair our broken electronics. In the process creating jobs and helping the environment. And for that, we salute them!
