      <h2>When Will Phonebloks Be Released (in my country)?</h2>
      <p>Short answer, never. Phonebloks is a movement, not a manufacturer. As such we’ll never release a product. Our aim is to aid the existing manufacturing industry with developing and producing modular products. Preferably using open source, open innovation and under a circular economy. Have a look on our <a href="https://phonebloks.com/development/">development</a> page to see the latest status.</p>

      <h2>Have Phonebloks Ever Crowdfunded?</h2>
      <p>No. Phonebloks has never been on Kickstarter, Indegogo or any of the crowdfunding sites out there. What we have done is a Thunderclap. A Thunderclap is when people donate their social reach instead of money, to help spread the word. Awesome. The original goal was to find 500 supporters but we ended up with over 979,000. We thereby reaching&nbsp;381,823,577 people on the 29th of October 2013, when our Thunderclap went out.

      <h2>Did Google Buy Phonebloks?</h2>
      <p>No! We are 100% independent and we plan to keep&nbsp;it that way. We do support what Google are doing with Project Ara, showing the world a modular mobile phone is possible. We’re determined to help and support wherever we can.</p>
